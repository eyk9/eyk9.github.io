<title>A Visual Representation of Microbiological Culture Data</title>
<br>An interactive sample case visualization reflecting the version of the tool used at the time of the study is available to view at the link below. 
<br>Checkboxes in the upper pane may be used to include or exclude desired culture result types. 
<br>Results may be sorted by clicking column headers where up/down arrows exist. Clicking again will reverse the ordering. 
<br>Mousing over individual sensitivities displays each cultureâ€™s microbiological report in the lower pane.
